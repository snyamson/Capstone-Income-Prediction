# Income Prediction Project

## Introduction
This project aims to predict income levels based on demographic factors. Leveraging machine learning techniques, we analyze various socio-economic attributes to forecast whether an individual earns above or below a certain income threshold.

## Business Understanding
Income inequality is a pressing issue globally. This project's goal is to create a predictive model to better understand and potentially mitigate income disparities. Accurately predicting income levels aids policymakers in addressing socio-economic disparities and developing targeted interventions to combat income inequality.

## Recommendations

1. **Targeted Policy Interventions**: Utilize EDA insights to identify demographic groups with lower income levels. Tailor policy interventions and support programs to address specific socio-economic disparities in these groups.

2. **Skills Enhancement Initiatives**: Focus on educational programs or skill-building initiatives for demographic segments facing income challenges. Target efforts towards improving skill sets and educational qualifications to enhance earning potential.

3. **Promote Equal Opportunities**: Address gender-based income gaps highlighted in the analysis. Advocate for policies fostering gender equality in the workforce to bridge income disparities between genders.

4. **Revise Occupational Diversity**: Encourage diversity in occupations and industries for underrepresented groups. Explore ways to increase representation and access to higher-paying sectors for these demographics.
